# color-palette-generator

This is a quirky project that uses the Math.random() function to generate random colors in both rgba and hex code formats. The number of colors generated depends on the selected value in the dropdown menu.

Each time the button is clicked or the dropdown is changed, three divs are cleared:
-The recipe div, displaying the colors in rgb and hex format
-The div holding the vertical bars
-The div holding the horizontal bars

The palette function then populates those divs with the updated colors.
